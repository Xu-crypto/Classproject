### Data Access
```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

```

```{r}
# Full file paths
ambient_pollution_file <- "C:/Users/antho/Downloads/Ambient air pollution attributable deaths.csv"
household_pollution_file <- "C:/Users/antho/Downloads/HouseHold Air Pollution Attributable deaths.csv"

# Read the CSV files into data frames
ambient_pollution_data <- read_csv(ambient_pollution_file)
household_pollution_data <- read_csv(household_pollution_file)

# Preview the first few rows of each dataset
head(ambient_pollution_data)
head(household_pollution_data)

# Print summary of each dataset
summary(ambient_pollution_data)
summary(household_pollution_data)
```

# Research Question

"How do deaths attributable to household air pollution compare to those caused by ambient air pollution across different regions and time periods?"

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
